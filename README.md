Post Forking 2: Electric Boogaloo
=====================================

## This plugin broke due to [33763](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33763), so it's not after WordPress 4.3. I'm leaving it here for antiquity.

Allow authors to "fork" a post, so edits can be suggested without affecting the
original until the changes are merged.

Only works on WordPress trunk and my patch on [#30232](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30232).
